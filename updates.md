# Updates and Bugs will be posted here soon!

* Suggestion/bug: Audit log doesn't search for channels name "welcome" or "general". This was posted in our Dev git (which is private for now) but it failed and a roll back to stable was started. 

* Info/bug: Mute doesn't have a duration or a unmute command yet. Main reason duration hasn't been added is because of the lack of SQL with legacy, this is becoming a more serious thing that we are working on. Same with the unmute command. It will be integrated with SQL so there's no point adding a command with no SQL NOW just to change it 3 or so weeks from now.

* Info: SQL as stated above we are working on adding it, database files may start to appear in legacy, but wont do anything till the modules have everything updated.

* Next Update: Were getting rid of boring text that the bot sends, so were going to be adding embeds. I am working on find a efficient way to trigger embeds. but its taking a lot of time to do such testing as well.
