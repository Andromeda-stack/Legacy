# Updates and Bugs will be posted here soon!

* Suggestion/bug: 

* Info/bug: Mute doesn't have a duration or a unmute command yet. Main reason duration hasn't been added is because of the lack of SQL with legacy, this is becoming a more serious thing that we are working on. Same with the unmute command. It will be integrated with SQL so there's no point adding a command with no SQL NOW just to change it 3 or so weeks from now.

* Info: sqlite3 has been roughly added, this feature is in beta. and code may look **sloppy**, always looking to merge better/safer tactics when it comes to sql.

* Info: Kick and Mute will have DB features shortly, theres still a few bugs with `warn` and a soon to-be feature `getWarnings`. Ideally id like those bugs fixed first before mute/kick get added, well see. 

* Info: Bot now searches for channel names, for joining and leaving. Theres two ways ive layed it out, You may either use the file for text, or use a json file for the text, either way works! just replace `channel-name-here` with the name of the channel you would like embeds for joining/leaving to goto.

* Next Update: Sql will start to be added, once files start to show the bot will automatically be put into BETA and marked unstable until further testing is conducted. Forks/testing would really help us fix/add things.
