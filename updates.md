# Updates and Bugs will be posted here soon!

* Suggestion/bug: Audit log doesn't search for channels name "welcome" or "general". This was posted in our Dev git (which is private for now) but it failed and a roll back to stable was started. 

* Info/bug: Mute doesn't have a duration or a unmute command yet. Main reason duration hasn't been added is because of the lack of SQL with legacy, this is becoming a more serious thing that we are working on. Same with the unmute command. It will be integrated with SQL so there's no point adding a command with no SQL NOW just to change it 3 or so weeks from now.

* Info: sqlite3 has been roughly added, this feature is in beta. and code may look **sloppy**, alawys looking to merge better/safer tatics when it comes to sql.

* Info: Ive added Command(ban) to the DB so it can be used, all other commands will be covered by DB soon. 

* Next Update: Sql will start to be added, once files start to show the bot will automatically be put into BETA and marked unstable until further testing is conducted. Forks/testing would really help us fix/add things.
