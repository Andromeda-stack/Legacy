npm i chalk (Simply for color text in console)

# Future

* There are plans for a Legacy V2, more then likely will be written in TypeScript, as this is more dynamic and cleaner.
* Legacy V1, will be updated to have and support Sqlite3, but wont have any other features added. Unless introduced by others
* Legacy V2 will not be released as an Open Source project until it becomes more popular, and used by other communities.
